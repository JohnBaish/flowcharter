# Flowcharter — working notes

**Create a flowchart from a list.** A sister tool to Clockmaker and
Backtimer (repo `JohnBaish/clockwheel`), for `flowcharter.baish.net`.

Read these first, in this order:

1. `SPEC.md`: what Flowcharter is and does (agreed with John).
2. `PLAN.md`: the staged build. Work one stage at a time, on its branch.
3. `HOUSE-STYLE.md`: the shared look and ways of working. Copied from
   `JohnBaish/clockwheel` on 2026-10-15 (at clockwheel commit `f62a1b1`).
   Clockwheel holds the master copy. If it has changed since, re-copy it and
   note that here.

Key points from the house style, repeated because they matter most:

- John is not a developer. Explain plainly and briefly, say what he needs to
  do, and use British spelling. He decides wording.
- Agree before building anything significant. Show rendered previews of
  images and icons before wiring them in.
- Build on a branch and merge to `main` only when John says so.
- Check in a real browser at 1200px and at 390px with touch emulation, and
  say what couldn't be checked.
- Never rename the storage key (`flowcharter-state-v1`) once live.
- Add a dated entry below for every change.

## Layout

- `src/`: the app (Vite + React + TypeScript; no backend).
  - `data/`: `shapes.ts` (the eight types and fills), `charts.ts` (types from
    SPEC §7, the seed chart, `newChart()`).
  - `lib/chartOps.ts`: **all the list's rules** (type guessing, routes, delete,
    reorder) as plain functions. Change list behaviour here, not in the screens.
  - `lib/exchange.ts`: checking and repairing anything read from outside (the
    browser's saved copy, import files) and the export format.
  - `state/store.tsx`: app state, `localStorage` (`flowcharter-state-v1`), and
    thin wrappers over `chartOps`.
  - `screens/`, `components/`: Library and List screens, Nav, the List header.
    `ChartScreen` and `GuideScreen` are placeholders until Stages 2 and 3.
  - `lib/`: also `icons.tsx`, `responsive.ts`, `useDragReorder.ts` (copied from
    clockwheel), `time.ts`, `focus.ts`.
  - `styles/organic.css`, `global.css`: from clockwheel; `global.css` is trimmed
    of Clockmaker-only rules and has the List screen's styles added.
- `scripts/check-chart-ops.ts`: `npm run check` tests `chartOps` and `exchange`
  (Node runs it directly; there is no test framework).
- `design/`: mock-ups and design sources, not app code. Open the HTML files
  from disk after `npm ci` (fonts load from `node_modules` by path).
  `previews/` holds their renders. `shapes.js` is the prototype shape
  geometry. `layout-spike.cjs` is the elkjs test (SPEC §5; needs `npm i elkjs`).
- Commands: `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run check`.
  `npm run lint` shows two `only-export-components` warnings (`icons.tsx`,
  `store.tsx`); clockwheel has the same ones, and they are harmless.

## Log

### 2026-10-15 — design agreed; spec, plan and previews (branch `spec-and-plan`)

**What:** Worked through the design with John (his answers are recorded in
SPEC.md). Wrote `SPEC.md`, `PLAN.md` and this file. Copied `HOUSE-STYLE.md`,
`organic.css`, `global.css` and `.gitignore` from clockwheel. Made previews
for John's approval: the eight shapes in their colours, and the List
(computer and phone) and Chart screens for the worked example.

**Decisions worth knowing:**

- The list uses "goes to" references, not nesting. A decision's answers are
  indented rows beneath it, each with an arrow label and a destination.
  Answers are drawn as labels on the arrows, not as boxes, per the
  conventions. Both were confirmed by John.
- Each type has its own pale fill. All eight were checked for ink contrast
  (≥10:1) and for being distinct from each other and from the cream page.
- Layout uses elkjs. A spike showed two required settings, model-order cycle
  breaking and ports on decisions (SPEC §5).

**Agreed later the same day:** the "then →" choice on ordinary rows (SPEC §4).

**Still to confirm with John:** the small Start/End-word addition to type guessing, and the footer and
library wording (SPEC §9).

**Left alone:** no app code yet. Nothing in clockwheel was changed.

**Verified:** previews rendered in Chromium (Playwright) at 1200px and at
390px with touch emulation. Brand fonts were confirmed loaded, there was no
sideways scroll at 390px, and there were no script errors.

### 2026-10-15 — Stage 1: the app, Library and List (branch `stage-1-list`)

**What:** Scaffolded the app to match clockwheel (same dependency versions,
tsconfigs, `oxlint`), then built the Library screen, the List screen (a table on
a computer, cards on a phone), the nav and header, saving in the browser,
Export/Import, the footer notice and Vercel Analytics. Chart and Guide are
placeholders. `main` had `spec-and-plan` merged into it first, at John's say-so.

**Why these choices:** see "Details settled while building Stage 1" in SPEC §4
for the behaviours John hasn't been asked about yet. Beyond those:

- The list's rules live in `lib/chartOps.ts` as plain functions, so they can be
  checked without a browser and Stage 2 can't accidentally depend on screen code.
- Everything read from outside is repaired by `lib/exchange.ts` (unknown shapes
  dropped, routes to missing rows cleared), so a damaged save or a hand-edited
  import file can't crash the app.
- The answer rows of a decision are in the same `<tbody>` (computer) or card
  (phone) as the decision, so dragging the grip moves them together, and the drop
  target covers the whole block.

**Left alone:** the Chart and Guide screens, Print, Copy image, favicon, link
preview tags and the Vercel project (Stages 2–3). No favicon means the browser
asks for `/favicon.ico` and gets a 404. Nothing in clockwheel was changed. The
`design/` files are as they were.

**Verified:**

- `npm run build` is clean; `npm run lint` has only the two warnings above;
  `npm run check` passes (19 checks).
- Real browser (Playwright, Chromium) against the built app, at 1200px and at
  390px with touch emulation: first-visit contents; adding rows by button and by
  Enter; type guessing; Yes/No answers; route count 2–6; loops; "needs a
  destination"; deleting with and without the confirmation; reordering by mouse
  on both layouts; reload keeps the same rows; Duplicate; Delete; Export file
  name and contents; Import (replace with confirmation, a Clockmaker file, a
  non-JSON file); New chart focusing the name box; hamburger menu. No page
  errors, no sideways scroll at 390px, nothing sticking out of a card, every box
  and button 44px tall or more on the phone, all boxes 16px text there.
- The only failed request locally is `/_vercel/insights/script.js`, which Vercel
  itself serves, so it is expected until the site is on Vercel.

**Couldn't be checked:** a real iPhone (the keyboard opening on Add, Safari's
drop-down and scrolling behaviour); dragging a card by touch (only a mouse at
phone width was tried — `useDragReorder` is clockwheel's, unchanged); Vercel
itself (the build there, Analytics, the preview link).
